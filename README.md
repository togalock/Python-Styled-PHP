# Python Styled PHP
As a Python developer transitioning to PHP, sometimes I wonder...

Can I bring the consistency of Python functions, into the world of PHP?

~~Why filter, map and reduce all have different syntaxes?!?~~

~~and getting lengths :(~~


## Libraries included
- [x] Inbuilt (80%, excluding some already there such as `chr()` and some incompatable datatypes such as tuples)
- [x] Random (80%, excluding distributions)
