# Python Styled PHP
As a Python developer transitioning to PHP, sometimes I wonder...

Can I bring the consistency of Python functions, into the world of PHP?

~~Why filter, map and reduce all have different syntaxes?!?~~

~~and getting lengths :(~~

## Remarks
1. `.`s in library namespaces are replaced with double underscores `__`.

1. Datatype specific operations starts with `_<datatype>__<operation>`. 

First argument should be the affected object, then python bindings.



## Libraries included
- [x] Inbuilt (80%, excluding some already there such as `chr()` and some incompatable datatypes such as tuples)
- [x] Random (80%, excluding distributions)
